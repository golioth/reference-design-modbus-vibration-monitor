/* RS-485 8 Click boards have their EN signal connected to the RST signal on the
 * mikroBUS headers. However, Elixir v1 Rev A boards do not have SW (GPIO)
 * control of the RST pins on the mikroBUS headers. To ensure the EN pin is
 * driven HIGH (enabled) for this app, a 10 KÎ© resistor must be soldered onto
 * the Click board between the EN pin and the 3.3V pin.
 *
 * Since the EN pin is not used for this board rev, we need to remove delete the
 * unused node from the shared app_common.dtsi overlay used by all other boards.
